# PCA-Project
# 📊 Date a Scientist — PCA Text Classification Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for **dimensionality reduction** on text data from dating profiles. It transforms high-dimensional TF-IDF text features into principal components and uses them to classify user attributes (e.g., age group).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Extract features from dating profile text using **TF-IDF**.
- Reduce feature space using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.
- Classify users based on reduced features using **Random Forest**.
- Evaluate model accuracy using a test dataset.
